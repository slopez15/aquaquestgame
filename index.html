					<p>This program is designed to raise awareness<br />for water deprivation in the form of a game.</p>
					<p>Getting to the end will prove your knowledge<br />of this globally spread issue.</p>
					<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
					<p>You are an explorer going on an adventure<br />in the lost lands of the Savanna Desert.<br />But the plane you were flying over the desert was shot down...</p>
					<p>You are now stranded in the middle of the desert...</p>
					<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
					<p>After crawling out of the crumbling plane wreckage<br />you cough and look for a drink of water.<br />Running out of time due to dehydration, do you check<br />the plane wreckage for supplies or move toward the smoke in the distance?<br />1 = Search
						Plane, 2 = Go Toward Smoke</p>
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>(1)<br />You manage to squeeze into the plane to search for supplies.<br />You finally notice a first aid kit and manage to pry it open<br />revealing only a few bandages and some gauze.<br />When you try to reach for the supplies a metal bar crashes
						in front of you<br />blocking your path to the supplies.<br />You quickly escape the plane and collapse in the sand outside...<br />(end 1)<br /></div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">(2)<br />Traversing into the barren landscape, you seem to walk endlessly.<br />Your vision fades as the smoke seems to be traveling even further away.<br />You collapse from dehydration...<br />(end 2)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pure-u-5-5">
					<p>You slowly awaken to the view of straw above your head.<br />You roll your head to the side to reveal what seems to be a way out of the hut.</p>
					<p>You get out of your straw bed and look down seeing marks all over your body.<br />After leaving the hut you emerge to find a large group of people gathered.<br />From the crowd emerges an elder character covered with marks matching yours.</p>
					<p>The elder says a chant and everyone in the crowd cheers.<br />He approaches you and tells you, 'I am so honored to meet you!'</p>
					<p>Do you return the Gesture or ask where you are?<br />1 = Say you're honored, 2 = Where am I?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>(1)<br />They reply 'Yes, we have much to discuss, follow...'<br />(end 1)<br /></div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">(2)<br />They reply 'All in good time, we have much to discuss, follow...'<br />(end 2)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pure-u-5-5">
					<p>The elder leads you through a small village surrounded by barren wasteland.<br />When you notice they enter a tent covered in the same markings as on your body and the elder's.<br />Do you enter the tent or make a run for it?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>(1)<br />You slowly walk toward the tent...<br />(end 1)<br />
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">(2)<br />You are too tired to run, you decide to enter the tent...<br />(end 2)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pure-u-5-5">
					<p>You enter the tent to reveal a group of elders sitting in a circle all covered in similar marks.<br />You are gestured to the center of the room where the elders give you a look of concern.<br />Do you ask about their concern or stay quiet?<br />1
						= Ask, 2 = Stay Quiet</p>
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>(1)<br />You ask about their concerned faces, answered only with silence...<br />(end1)</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">(2)<br />You stay quiet, as their concerned faces unfleeting.<br />(end 2)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pure-u-5-5">
					<p>Finally one of the elders speaks up,<br />'Water is running short in our village, we are convinced that you are the chosen one.'<br />Another elder stands and starts to speak,<br />'884 million people are without clean water!'<br />Another elder
						quickly mumbles, 'That's more than 11% of the world's population.'</p>
					<p>'Every minute a child dies of water related illness,' continued the elder,<br />'840,000 people die each year from water related disease, all of these could be prevented!'<br />'You have the power to stop this!' adds another elder.<br />'Yes! the
						prophecy!' chimes another.<br />'Long ago, before water pollution and drought, there was an ancient stone that rested in a cave'<br />'The stone kept all water on earth clean! Then an evil being known as Pollutoron took the rock from its resting
						place'
						<br />'You must climb Mt. Pollution to get the rock back and return it to the cave!'</p>
					<p>Are you the chosen one?<br />1 = YES!, 2 = Maybe?, 3 = NO!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
					<p>(1)<br />The elders commend you for your bravery and bestow you with a map that will help you on your journey.<br />You stand up, and with nothing in your way you traverse to Mt. Pollution!<br />(end 1)</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-3">(2)<br />Scared for the journey ahead, you look around, but the affirmative looks of all the elders convinces you!<br />The elders bestow you with a map that will help you on your journey<br />You leave the tent confident in your ability to traverse
					Mt. Pollution<br />(end 2)</div>
				<div class="option pure-u-1-3">(3)<br />You think that there's no way to do this! Thinking it an impossible task, you decide to give up.<br />But then you remember how these people saved your life and decide to continue on!<br />The elders bestow you with a map that will help you
					on your journey and you leave the tent to face Mt. Pollution. (end 3)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pure-u-2-3">
					<p>You come to the base of the mountain and learn of the peril you're about to experience.<br />You notice a river circling the base of the mountain the liquid so filthy you can't tell if it's even water anymore.<br />The elder's voice echoing through
						your head "884 million people have to drink water this dirty or worse!"</p>
					<p>There seems to be no easy way up the mountain, you begin to climb with caution....</p>
					<p>After climbing for what seems like hours you stumble upon a small cave entrance.<br />Going in here could make it easier to get up the mountain! <br />Do you go in?(Karma Neutral)</p>
				</div>

				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>if yes:</p>
					<p>It's a tight squeeze, but you manage to get into the cave.<br />There seems to light further into the cave.<br />After traversing the cave, you emerge on the top of the mountain.<br />There you notice a wall of thick fog is surrounding the mountain,
						blocking any view.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>if no:</p>
					<p>You decide to not waste time but rather continue your journey up the steep terrain.<br />After a treacherous journey up the mountain you reach what has to be the peak.<br />Looking behind you, the view of the desert you expected is instead blocked
						by a wall of immense fog.</p>
					<p>Where they join:<br />The air is heavy, each breath a challenge.<br />You look around the peak of the mountain and notice a pool of water.<br />The water is extremely dirty except the far side, which a small stone is resting atop a boulder.<br />A
						circle of clean water surrounds the stone.</p>
					<p>This has to be the ancient stone the elders mentioned!</p>
					<p>Do you run in and grab it, or walk around the edge of the mountain's peak to grab it carefully?(Karma Neutral)</p>
				</div>

				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>if walk through water:</p>
					<p>Walking through the water, unsure of how deep it is you are quickly up to your waist in water.<br />You grab the stone and notice the water become completely dirty as soon as you remove it.<br />Then the water starts to heat up, so you quickly get
						out.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="option pure-u-1-2">
					<p>if walking around the mountain:</p>
					<p>You carefully walk around the water on the edge of the mountain, consciously traversing the rocks.<br />Finally, you reach the stone.<br />You take it off the boulder and go back to the entrance to the pools.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pure-u-2-3">
					<p>JOIN HERE:</p>
					<p>You look at the water and see it slowly start to bubble!<br />The water, now scalding, starts to crack the weak earth beneath it, shaking the ground.<br />Through the crack you see a bright red light, it's magma! The mountain is a Volcano!<br />The
						volcano has been awoken by taking the stone!</p>
					<p>In panic you hurry back to the path down the mountain, only to see that down the entire volcano, lava is pouring onto the path<br />Looking desperately for another path, you look behind you only to be plagued by the lava level rising, cascading toward
						you!<br />Do you try to go down the path or go on a higher rock?</p>
					<div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>path:</p>
							<p>Choosing to get off the volcano as quick as possible, you begin to traverse the path.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>higher rock:</p>
							<p>You decide to get away from the lava no matter the cost!</p>
							<p>You climb a nearby rock and get above the lava's level, but the level is rising!<br />You see an opening in the lava's path of destruction and decide to go down!</p>
						</div>

						<div class="pure-u-2-3">
							<p>JOIN HERE:</p>
							<p>Going down the volcano you see a bird's wing trapped under a rock trying to fly away<br />Do you help the pinned bird and risk your journey, or do you consider countless people depending on you and flee?(help = +5 Karma, not help = -5 Karma)</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>HELP:</p>
							<p>You struggle to get to the bird but manage to free it from the rock, letting it fly away.<br />On the other side of where the bird was stuck is an open path leading to the bottom.<br />You take the easy path and race down the volcano being chased
								by an avalanche of lava.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>No help:</p>
							<p>You can't stop! Lava is right behind you and there's no risking it now!<br />The journey is nearly impossible, dodging every falling rock while being chased by the endless cascade of lava.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="pure-u-2-3">
							<p>JOIN HERE:</p>
							<p>Finally reaching the bottom, you get as far away from the volcano as possible!<br />When finally safe from the barrage of flaming boulders, you prepare to embark on the journey to the cave unable to spend any time resting.<br />You pull out the
								tattered map given to you by the elders.<br />Faintly, you see the location of the cave past a river nearby painted with a barely visible ink.</p>
							<p>Heading toward the river you see another village near the water.<br />Going through the village, you notice the damage done by the lack of clean water.</p>
							<p>Finally, a old bridge approaches that extends to the other side of the river. <br />As you cross, every step sends chills down your spine, terrified of the thought of falling in. <br />You think to yourself 'In the very near future, billions of
								people could be forced to drink this. I have to do this.'</p>
							<p>The cave is not far now.<br />You see it come into view but the cave looks ominous.</p>
							<p>You approach the cave with caution. Once inside however, you feel a calm wave cascade over your body.<br />You follow a narrow path for what seems like miles, rocks project at you from every direction.</p>
							<p>Reaching the end, your vision encapsulates a boulder with a hole the perfect size for the rock!<br />A waterfall showers the boulder and runs down into a dark pool standing between you and the boulder.<br />Seeking the fastest route, you jump into
								the pool and begin to wade through the enormously deep pool in front of you.</p>
							<p>Walking into the water you feel the water becoming thicker.<br />Looking down you see the water becoming more polluted with every second.<br />You try to hurry to the boulder, but before you're able to reach it a large sludge covered monster rises
								from the water.<br />You attempt to back out of the water as the monster lets out a booming roar.<br />You manage drag yourself out and hide behind a large rock nearby.</p>
							<p>There, you realize the monster could only be one thing: Pollutoron!<br />You know you have to get the rock in the boulder to stop him, it's the only way!<br />You peak around cover you now notice that there's three paths:<br />A ramp that goes
								above his head so you could jump on the boulder from above<br />A covered path that you could go around the monster and try and sneak the stone into the hole<br />Or you could charge through and run past him, the fastest but riskiest way!</p>
						</div>
						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>Ramp:</p>
							<p>You run above the monster and jump down while Pollutoron struggles to turn toward you.<br />Landing right in front of the boulder you place the stone into the boulder.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>Covered:</p>
							<p>Running along the covered path you dodge balls of slime hurled at you from Pollutoron.<br />Emerging at a secret entrance right next to the boulder you quickly put the stone into the boulder.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>Charge:</p>
							<p>Charging straight for the boulder you almost dodge Pollutoron, however he catches you.<br />Pollutoron hurls you, sending you flying onto the top ramp, he tries to follow you, but this leaves an opening.<br />You manage to jump down above Pollutoron
								and make a dash for the boulder, placing it inside.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="pure-u-2-3">
							<p>JOIN:</p>
							<p>The stone emits a light!<br />As the water around the boulder becomes cleaner with every passing second.<br />Pollutoron slowly decaying letting out screams of anguish toward you!</p>
						</div>


						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>Good:</p>
							<p>You have just made all water on earth drinkable! Potentially saving 884 Million lives!</p>
						</div>

						<div class="option pure-u-1-3">
							<p>Bad:</p>
							<p>Despite you valiant efforts, the water slowly became dirty over time again due to your impure actions. Try again to attempt at having a different ending!</p>

							<p>Sadly, this issue is real, but the solution is not. <br />Helping the people suffering from this globally reaching issue is not as simple as putting a magic stone into a boulder.<br />But that does not mean that all hope is lost! <br />There are
								a variety of organizations listed below that are dedicated to helping solve this problem that could use your help!</p>
